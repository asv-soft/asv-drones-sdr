# asv-drones-sdr
The SDR payload for drones is a cutting-edge solution that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform a variety of critical functions. This payload includes a state-of-the-art software-defined radio (SDR) that can be easily configured to support a wide range of frequency bands and modulation schemes, making it highly versatile and adaptable to different mission requirements.

In addition to its advanced communication capabilities, the SDR payload for drones also includes features such as geolocation and spectrum analysis, which enable operators to quickly and accurately locate and analyze radio signals in the surrounding environment. This information can be used to enhance situational awareness and support mission planning and execution.
